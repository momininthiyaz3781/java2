Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare a variable as int

Step 3: Ask for an input from the user (input = num)

Step 4: Check if the input is divisible by 2 (num%2 == 0)

Step 5: If the number is divisible by 2 then print square of number (num*num) 
        print result

Step 6: If the number is not divisible by 2 then print cube of number (num*num*num) 
        print result

Step 7: End
